# Spellstorm (2023)

Spellstorm was my first personal VR project. At that time I was learning Unity VFX graph so I decided to create a VR duelist spell battle game.  The game idea is that there will be multiple magic classes to chose from. Each class has its unique gauntlet controlling different element allowing player for multiple playstyles to chose from.
